        access to, and use of, the Website is at your own risk, and you are solely
        responsible for any damage to your computer, device, system, or data.
        Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for
        consequential or incidental damages, in such states, liability is limited to the
        fullest extent permitted by law.<br/><br/>
        Notwithstanding the above, our sole liability for any reason to you, and your
        sole and exclusive remedy for any cause or claim whatsoever, shall be limited

        to your access to and activities with respect to the Website and Website
        Content, or relating to any activity, information, or service, provided by us or
        any of our agents or employees or agents. You assume personal
        responsibility for any injury or harm of any kind (including, but not limited to,
        psychological or emotional injuries), illness, damage, loss, claim, liability or
        expense, of any kind or nature, that your person or property may suffer arising
        out of or in connection with the Website or Website Content or use therein.
        By viewing the Website you agree to fully release, indemnify, and hold

        to: (a) your use of or reliance on the information presented on the Website;
        (b) your violation of these Terms of Use or of applicable laws or regulations; or
        (c) any content you uploaded to the Website. Company reserves the right, at
        your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for
        which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our

        written consent of the Company. The company will use reasonable efforts to
        notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of
        it.<br/><br/>
        You recognize and confirm that in the event you incur any damages, losses or
        injuries that arise out of Company&apos;s acts or omissions, the damages, if any,
        caused to you are not irreparable or sufficient to entitle you to an injunction
        preventing any exploitation of any website, property, product, program, other
        owned or controlled by Company, and you will have no rights to enjoin or
        restrain the development, production, distribution, advertising, exhibition or
        exploitation of any Company website, property, product, program, other
        content or any and all activities or actions related thereto. By accessing this
        Website, you understand that you may be waiving rights with respect to
        claims that are at this time unknown or unsuspected. In accordance with
        such waiver, if you are a California resident, you acknowledge that you have
        read and understand, and hereby expressly waive, the benefits of section 1542
        of the civil code of California, and any similar law of any state or territory,
        which provides as follows: &apos;A general release does not extend to claims which
        the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of
        executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected
        his settlement with the debtor.&apos;<br/><br/>
        <b>Account Hold</b><br/>
        If Company believes, in its sole discretion, that any funds were earned under
        suspicious circumstances or that funds were derived from a suspect account,
        Company will continue to investigate the situation until an adequate
        resolution has been reached, as determined by us, and which may require the
        involvement of certain third parties, including any applicable credit card
        company. The company will make commercially reasonable efforts not to
        exceed a ninety-day (90) hold on your account as we and/or a third-party
        investigate.

        No Assignment: You may not assign, transfer or delegate your rights or
